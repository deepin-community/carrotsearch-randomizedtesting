BUGS:

* search highlighting does not work in method view


TODO, must have:

* Console output generated by package, class and method
* Unified (linear) console log view across all tests (alternative to package/class/method view)
* Showing information about slaves
* Showing RR-specific annotations
* Indication next to package/class/method that there was console output
* Display of global overrides
* Detailed test method view
  * class name
  * method name
  * annotations:
    * seeds
    * repetitions
    * timeout
    * expected exceptions
  * slave
  * staus: ok, ignored by assumption, ignored by annotation, failed, error
  * execution time
  * stack trace
  * console output
* ignored by assumption vs by annotation in descriptions
* global start date in header (because individual tests report just time)
* multiple column sorting tip
* fix white gaps in status bar
* keyboard navigation + hints
* fix changing column width when adding sorting
* drop the array/push/joing paradigm for string building, string concatenation is now faster


Nice to have:

* paging in method view on slow machines?
* Automatic/configurable abbreviation of package names
* Deemphasizing common prefix (package, class name) in class and method view.
* Minification of assets
* Clean-up of data JSON (smaller size)
* Table filters: by status
* bookmarkable links
* Links for opening in an IDE
* Copying stack trace to clipboard?


To decide:

* Generation of markup in JS makes things easy, but is terrible for indexing in search engines.
  Maybe there should be some pre-rendered version as well?

* Showing aggregations by the slave they ran on (like by package/method)?

* Mobile version?


Testing:

* Empty report
* All failures
* All errors
* All ignored
* All passed
* One vs many (string formatting)
* Performance
* Classes in the default package


DONE:

* Showing test in the execution order (only in method view), per slave order
* Showing failing tests first (if any test failed/errored)
* General indication of ok / failure in document title
* A "bulb" indication of general ok / failure (green/red, like in Bamboo)
* Table filters: free text
* navigation: package -> class -> method and back
* Hiding irrelevant parts of the stack trace? (filtering of certain packages)
* navigation using HTML5 history API (bookmarkable urls)
